# BUDDY - AI Study Partner 📚✨

✅ **Gemini API Integration** — Uses Google’s Gemini model for advanced LLM answers  
✅ **Modern Full-Stack** — React frontend + Python Flask backend  
✅ **Privacy-First** — Only relevant note snippets are sent to Gemini; your full notes stay private

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

Buddy is designed with **local-first privacy** in mind. 

Only the **necessary note snippet** is sent to the Gemini API — never the entire file.  

Your study material stays on your machine — no permanent cloud storage, no hidden uploads.

- 📌 Study streak tracker and smart reminders
  
- 📌 Improved text chunking with embeddings or semantic search
